            <h2>About the Earth Kingdom</h2>
            <p>
                The Fire Nation is located in the Western Hemisphere of the world, and is composed of several large islands.
                It's capital is simply called the Fire Nation Capital. The Fire Lord and their family reside in the capital. The capital is guarded by the Great Gates of 
                Azulon, named after Zuko and Azula's grandfather, Fire Lord Azulon. The Fire Nation is regarded as the most 
                powerful nation due to its advanced technology and abundant resources, due largely in part to the many active volcanos located in the nation. 
                <br><br>
                The Fire Nation was formed by humans who were gifted the ability to energybend by the Lion Turtles. However, after the Lion Turles rescinded 
                their roles as protectors of humanity, the humans with the gift of firebending congregated to form the Fire Nation. They formed separate villages within the nation, 
                the most notable one being the Sun Warriors civilization. The Sun Warriors developed the original firebending techniques from dragons, but eventually went into hiding. Eventually, the villages 
                were united by a man who became to be known as the first Fire Lord. There was great peace and prosperity within the nation for many years.
                <br><br>
                However, during his reign, Fire Lord Sozin declared war on all other nations, seeking to bestow the entire world with the 
                prosperity of the Fire Nation. This was the beginning of the Hundred Year War.
