            <h2>About the Earth Kingdom</h2>
            <p>
                The Water Tribe is the collective term for both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes. The Northern Water 
                Tribe is located at the north pole, while the Southern Water Tribe is located at the south pole. However, both tribes were 
                primarily governed by the Northern Water Tribe, up until 171 AG. There was a brief civil war, which resulted in the Southern Water Tribe 
                becoming completely independent from the Northern Water Tribe. 
            <br><br>
                The Water Tribes were formed by humans who gained the ability to energybend from the Lion Turtles. However, after the lion turtles rescinded their roles as 
                protectors of humanity, the first people of the Water Tribes settled on the North pole, despite having originated in more tropical climates. After a time of peace, a few people 
                from the Northern Water Tribe became unsastified with life on the North Pole, and went South to form the Southern Water Tribe. This resulted in many cultural differences between the two tribes.
            <br><br>
                 Both Water Tribes are weaker than the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom, due largely in part to their geographical location. Neither tribe has access to 
                farmable land, and relies entirely on what resources they can gather from the ocean. Because of this, the people of the Water Tribes are generally peaceful, and strive to 
                coexist with the nature that they rely upon. During the Hundred Year War, the Southern Water Tribe lost most of its power, and was almost defeated entirely due to the 
                constant raids by the Fire Nation.
